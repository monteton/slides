# Blueprint: "СЛАЙДЫ" Cover Band Landing Page

## Project Overview

This project is a modern, single-page landing page for the Sochi-based cover band "СЛАЙДЫ". The design is dynamic and visually engaging, featuring a neon-orange theme, the custom font "Orbitron" (as a replacement for "Eurofurence"), and a variety of interactive and animated elements. The page showcases the band's portfolio, including their history, members, programs, and media content, with a strong emphasis on their live performances.

## Implemented Features

### Design and Style:
*   **Theme:** Dynamic neon-orange aesthetic with animated gradients and light ray effects. Uses CSS variables for theme colors (`--primary-color`, `--secondary-color`).
*   **Typography:** Uses "Orbitron" font for headings and "Roboto" for body text, imported from Google Fonts.
*   **Layout:** A **responsive**, single-page layout with distinct sections for different types of content. The design is now adapted for mobile devices using media queries.
*   **Visuals:** Replaced placeholder images with more relevant, high-quality images from Unsplash. Added icons for contact links from `icons8` and a favicon.
*   **Interactivity:** Added hover effects for buttons, images, and links. A smooth scrolling JavaScript enhances navigation.

### Content Sections:
1.  **Hero Section:** Features an animated gradient background, light ray effects, and a prominent call-to-action button with a glow effect.
2.  **About Us:** Includes a list of achievements and a gallery with hover effects.
3.  **Band Members & Tech:** Displays circular portraits of band members with a border and shadow effect, plus technical photos.
4.  **Programs & Formats:** Details the band's flexible programs with an accompanying image gallery.
5.  **Photo Carousel:** A section with an auto-playing and manually controllable image carousel.
6.  **Video Carousel:** The video block has been converted into a manually controlled carousel to showcase multiple performance videos.
7.  **Testimonials:** Styled quotes from clients.
8.  **Contact & Booking:** A styled contact form and prominent icon links for phone, email, Telegram, and VK.
9.  **Footer:** Contains social media links and a placeholder for a privacy policy.

## Current Plan

The landing page is now fully responsive and features two carousels: one for photos and one for videos. The styling has been enhanced with a dynamic neon theme, improved typography, and interactive elements. Placeholder images and videos have been used throughout the site. The next steps will involve replacing these placeholders with the actual content provided by the band, such as real photos, video IDs, and specific contact details.
